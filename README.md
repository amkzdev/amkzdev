# Hi there! My name is Amir Mahdi (AMKZ)


**I am a Front End developer with over 4 years of experience**. I specialize in using Javascript, Typescript, Reactjs, and Next Js to create stunning web applications. Throughout my career, I have developed numerous industrial projects that have helped me gain a deeper understanding of the industry's nuances.

One thing that sets me apart from others is my eye for design. I believe that a well-designed website not only looks great but also functions smoothly. I always strive to create user-friendly interfaces that make navigating through the website a breeze.

Thank you for taking the time to read my about me! If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me.
